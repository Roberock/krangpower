Configuration file
==================

Krangpower comes with a configuration file that can be found in the package folder, under :code:`/config/krang_config.cfg`.
The sections are the following, and the single parameters should be sufficiently self-explicative.

    * data_files
    * temp_files
    * log_settings
    * precision
    * misc_settings

.. note::

    :code:`misc_settings` is the only section containing options that can be, at first, a little obscure; keep in mind
    that this section contains parameters that have a cosmetic effect on the logs and packages and no influence on
    functionality.
