The name krangpower
...................

Remember the Ninja Turtles? Krang, one of their enemies, was a genius-grade brain that could clumsily move only with his
two little tentacles, so he used a bionic suit in order to gain strength and the ability to move and operate with ease.
OpenDSS, too, is a genius-grade brain that can interact with the world only through a vintage COM interface.
Krangpower is an attempt to endow it with an empowering suit. Dimension X will be ours.


The developers
..............

We're a SUPSI_ research team and we study smart grid and smart energetic systems algorithms and control. Federico Rosato, the main dev of krangpower, takes care in particular of
the electric grid simulation frameworks.
