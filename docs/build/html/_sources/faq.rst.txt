**Q: Krang?**

A: Remember the Ninja Turtles? Krang, one of their enemies, was a genius-grade brain that used a bionic suit in order to gain strength and the ability to move and operate with ease. OpenDSS, too, is a genius-grade brain that can interact with the world only through a vintage COM interface. I tried to endow it with a suit.


**Q: Wait a minute! << is not meant to do operations in-place! You're a criminal!**

A: Call the cops.
